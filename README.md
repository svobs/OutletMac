## Prerequisites

	sudo gem install cocoapods

	brew install swift-protobuf
	(see: https://crlacayo.me/2020/01/15/swift-protobuf/)

	pod install
	Afterwards look in: './Pods/gRPC-Swift-Plugins/' for 'protoc-gen-swift' and 'protoc-gen-grpc-swift'

## TODO
- connection hang causes Connection Problem View to fail to open?
- need to implement timeout for grpc requests
